# 0x13. Firewall

## Concepts
* DevOps
* SysAdmin
* Security

## Tasks
> Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports:
* 22 (SSH)
* 443 (HTTPS SSL)
* 80 (HTTP)

> Firewalls can not only filter requests, they can also forward them.
* Requirements:
* Configure web-01 so that its firewall redirects port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP
